## Doctor Pretty

A Swift implementation of the [A prettier printer (Wadler 2003)](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf) paper (including generally accepted modern enhancements ala [wl-pprint-annotated](https://github.com/minad/wl-pprint-annotated/blob/master/src/Text/PrettyPrint/Annotated/WL.hs).

---

## WIP do not use yet

The implementation does not have larger stress tests yet.

Please feel free to contribute though!

In addition to the paper, I'm using [wl-pprint-annotated](https://github.com/minad/wl-pprint-annotated/blob/master/src/Text/PrettyPrint/Annotated/WL.hs) as a guide for this implementation.
